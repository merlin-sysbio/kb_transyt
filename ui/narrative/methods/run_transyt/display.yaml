parameters :
    genome_id :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            <i>TranSyT</i> assings the reactions to the model based on the genome
    model_id :
        ui-name : |
            Model
        short-hint : |
            Metabolic model to extract the compounds already present in the model
        long-hint: |
            The metabolic model is used to filter reactions that may contain compounds that are not present. If
            not provided, a large set of false positives may be assigned to the model.
    rule:
        ui-name: |
            Model result rules
        short-hint: |
            Replace the transporters available in the model by the transporters found with <i>TranSyT</i>
        long-hint: |
            Option 1 replaces all transport reactions that might already be present in the model.
            Option 2 merges existing and new transport reactions, while keeping the GPRs already present in the model.
            Option 3 merges existing and new transport reactions, as well as GPRs. Ex: If rule 'A and B' was already in
            the model and rule 'C and D' was discovered by <i>TranSyT</i>, the new rule will be: '(A and B) or (C and D).
            Option 4 merges existing and new transport reactions, while keeping the new GPRs generated by <i>TranSyT</i>.
    cpmds_filter:
        ui-name: |
            Filter reactions by compounds present in model
        short-hint: |
            If true, <i>TranSyT</i> will use the compounds present in the model to filter reactions with no possible flux
    auto_accept_evalue:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold to automatically accept hits
        short-hint: |
            The value below which all hits are accepted as possible transporters
        long-hint: |
            Used in <i>TranSyT</i>'s 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
             due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in <i>TranSyT</i>’s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the
            respective genes.
    percent_accept:
        ui-name: |
            Percentage top blast results acceptance
        short-hint: |
            Percentage of top blast results that should be accepted
        long-hint: |
            Percentage of top blast results between thresholds that should be accepted for each query gene.
    limit_evalue_accept:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold lower threshold method-1
        short-hint: |
            The value above which all results should be disregarded by method-1.
        long-hint: |
            Used in <i>TranSyT</i>'s 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
            due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in <i>TranSyT</i>’s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the
            respective genes.
    override_ontologies_filter:
        ui-name: |
            Override ontologies filter
        short-hint: |
            Override the default filter that only accepts compounds with common ontologies
        long-hint: |
            If checked, overrides the ontologies filter that searches only the common hierarquical descendants described in TCDB for
            the TC number and TC family.

            This parameter must be used when a taxonomy identifier is not already available in the genome
    accept_unk_family:
        ui-name: |
            Accept unknown families (TC class 9)
        short-hint: |
            If true, <i>TranSyT</i> will accept transporters from incompletely characterized (putative) families of transporters
    accept_transyt_ids:
        ui-name: |
            Accept <i>TranSyT</i> identifiers if ModelSEED reference not found
        short-hint: |
            If true, <i>TranSyT</i> will use its identifiers in reactions where a ModelSEED reference is not available
        long-hint: |
            <i>TranSyT</i> always tries to identify its reactions using ModelSEED identifiers. If the contidion is set to true,
            <i>TranSyT</i> will use its identifiers in reactions where a ModelSEED reference is not available. Otherwise,
            reactions without a ModelSEED reference will be ignored.

    <p>The Transport Systems Tracker (<i>TranSyT</i>) is a tool to identify transport systems and the compounds carried
    across membranes based on the annotations of the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB). In addition, this
    tool also generates the respective transport reactions while providing the respective Gene-Protein-Reaction
    associations. The tool uses information retrieved from <a href="http://www.tcdb.org/">TCDB</a>, a membrane
    transport proteins' database containing structural, functional, mechanistic, evolutionary and disease/medical information
    about transport systems.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><i>TranSyT</i> takes a genome and a metabolic model as input. A set of parameters can also be defined by the
    user in order to change the stringency of the rules followed by the software. The effects of each parameter are
    described at the <em>Parameters</em> section below.</p>

    <p>KBase offers several ways to load genomes and metabolic models into a Narrative so that they can be used as
    one of the required inputs for this and other Apps:
       <ol>
         <li>Upload your own data from your local machine.</li>
         <li>Search for and add to the Narrative a genome or metabolic model from KBase&apos;s reference data collection.</li>
         <li>Use example data from the Data Browser slideout.</li>
         <li>Use a genome or metabolic model that you worked with in another Narrative or that another user has shared with you.</li>
       </ol>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Output Report</strong><br>Once the App finishes running, an output report is generated detailing the
    results. The report is built based on the parameters selected by the user. Thus, one or more of the following tabs
    can be displayed:
        <ul>
            <li><u>New reactions:</u> Reactions that were not already represented in the model and were integrated are
             shown in this tab. Despite using its own identifiers, if a equivalent ModelSEED reaction identifier is available,
             <i>TranSyT</i> will put a reference, along with the reaction equation and respective GPR.</li>
            <li><u>Reactions GPR modified:</u> If the parameter to merge or replace reactions' GPRs is selected, <i>TranSyT</i>
            shows in this tab the changes that were performed.</li>
            <li><u>Reactions removed:</u> When the option to replace all transport reactions already present in the
             model is selected, the set of removed reactions is displayed in this tab.</li>
            <li><u>Reactions not saved (ModelSEED ID not found):</u> When an equivalent ModelSEED reaction identifier
             is not available and the checkbox of the advanced parameter <em>Accept TranSyT identifiers if ModelSEED
             reference not found</em> is not selected, <i>TranSyT</i> does not save such reactions in the model, but
             creates this tab containig the log of disregarded reaction.</li>
        </ul>
