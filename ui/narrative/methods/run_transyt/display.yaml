parameters :
    genome_id :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            TranSyT assings the reactions to the model based on the genome
    model_id :
        ui-name : |
            Model
        short-hint : |
            Metabolic model to extract the compounds already present in the model
        long-hint: |
            The metabolic model is used to filter reactions that may contain compounds that are not present. If
            not provided, a large set of false positives may be assigned to the model.
    replace_trans:
        ui-name: |
            Replace model transporters
        short-hint: |
            Replace the transporters available in the model by the transporters found with TranSyT
        long-hint: |
            If true, TranSyT will replace all transporters in the model by the ones found by it. Otherwise, it will
            attempt to merge the reactions already present in the model with the new ones. While merging, if a reaction
            already exists, its GPR might be replaced by the new one.
    cpmds_filter:
        ui-name: |
            Filter by compounds present in model
        short-hint: |
            If true, TranSyT will use the compounds present in the model to filter reactions with no possible flux
    auto_accept_evalue:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold to automatically accept hits
        short-hint: |
            The value below which all hits are accepted as possible transporters
        long-hint: |
            Used in TranSyT's 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
             due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in TranSyT’s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the
            respective genes.
    percent_accept:
        ui-name: |
            Percentage top blast results acceptance
        short-hint: |
            Percentage of top blast results that should be accepted
        long-hint: |
            Percentage of top blast results between thresholds that should be accepted for each query gene.
    limit_evalue_accept:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold lower threshold method-1
        short-hint: |
            The value above which all results should be disregarded by method-1.
        long-hint: |
            Used in TranSyT's 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
            due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in TranSyT’s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the
            respective genes.
    override_ontologies_filter:
        ui-name: |
            Override ontologies filter
        short-hint: |
            Override the default filter that only accepts compounds with common ontologies
        long-hint: |
            If checked, overrides the ontologies filter that searches only the common hierarquical descendants described in TCDB for
            the TC number and TC family.
    blast_evalue_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast E-value threshold
        short-hint: |
            Blast E-value threshold
        long-hint: |
            Parameter '-evalue' of the NCBI Blast+ software
    bitscore_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast bit score threshold

            Parameter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    query_coverage_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast minimum query coverage threshold
        short-hint: |
            Parameter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    similarity_score:
        ui-name: |
            Blast similarity score
        short-hint: |
            Parameter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    alpha:
        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation alpha value
        short-hint: |
            Parameter used to balance the weight between frequency and taxonomy scores
    beta:
        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation beta value
        short-hint: |
            Penalty of reactions that are associated to a low number of homologous genes (used in taxonomy score)
    minimum_hits_penalty:
        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation minimum hits penalty
        short-hint: |
            Minimum hits to avoid penalty in taxonomy score calculations

        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation score threshold

            Accept unknown families (TC class 9)
        short-hint: |
            If true, TranSyT will accept transporters from incompletely characterized (putative) families of transporters
    ignore_m2:
        ui-name: |
            Ignore sencond method of classification
        short-hint: |
            If true, TranSyT only use method-1 in its classifications.

description : |
    <p>The Transport Systems Tracker (TranSyT) is a tool to identify transport systems and the compounds carried
    across membranes, based on the annotations of the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB). In addition,
    this tool also generates the respective transport reactions while providing the respective
    Gene-Protein-Reaction associations.</p>
