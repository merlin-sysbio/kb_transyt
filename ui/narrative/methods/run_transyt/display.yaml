    <p>The Transport Systems Tracker (TranSyT) is a tool to identify transport systems and the compounds carried
    across membranes, based on the annotations of the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB). In addition,
    this tool also generates the respective transport reactions while providing the respective
    Gene-Protein-Reaction associations.</p>
