parameters :
    genome_id :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            TranSyT assings the reactions to the model based on the genome
    model_id :
        ui-name : |
            Model
        short-hint : |
            Metabolic model to extract the compounds already present in the model
        long-hint: |
            The metabolic model is used to filter reactions that may contain compounds that are not present. If
            not provided, a large set of false positives may be assigned to the model.
    output_name:
        ui-name: |
            Output name
        short-hint: |
            Name of the output object to create
    auto_accept_evalue:
        ui-name: |
            E-value threshold to automatically accept hits
        short-hint: |
            The value below which all hits are accepted as possible transporters
        long-hint: |
            Used in TranSyT's 'auto accept' method. This does not take the taxonomy of the BLAST hits into account,
             due to the high similarity with the query sequence. All reactions available in TranSyTâ€™s internal database
            associated with TCDB entries that comply with the the specified conditions, will be assigned to the
            respective genes.
    override_ontologies_filter:
        ui-name: |
            Override ontologies filter
        short-hint: |
            Override the default filter that only accepts compounds with common ontologies
        long-hint: |
            If checked, overrides the ontologies filter that searches only the common hierarquical descendants described in TCDB for
            the TC number and TC family.
    blast_evalue_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast E-value threshold
        short-hint: |
            Blast E-value threshold
        long-hint: |
            Parameter '-evalue' of the NCBI Blast+ software
    bitscore_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast bit score threshold
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    query_coverage_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Blast minimum query coverage threshold
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    similarity_score:
        ui-name: |
            Blast similarity score
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to filter the results of the NCBI Blast+ software
    alpha:
        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation alpha value
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to balance the weight between frenquency and taxonomy scores
    beta:
        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation beta value
        short-hint: |
            Penalty of reactions that are associated to a low number of homologous genes (used in taxonomy score)
    minimum_hits_penalty:
        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation minimum hits penalty
        short-hint: |
            Minimum hits to avoid penalty in taxonomy score calculations
    score_threshold:
        ui-name: |
            Reactions annotation score threshold
        short-hint: |
            Score above which a reaction is accepted
    alpha_families:
        ui-name: |
            TC families annotation alpha value
        short-hint: |
            Paramenter used to balance the weight between frenquency and similarity scores
    accept_unk_family:
        ui-name: |
            Accept unknown families (TC class 9)
        short-hint: |
            If true, TranSyT will accept transporters from incompletely characterized (putative) families of transporters

    <p>The Transport Systems Tracker (TranSyT) is a tool to identify transport systems and the compounds carried
    across membranes, based on the annotations of the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB). In addition,
    this tool also generates the respective transport reactions while providing the respective
    Gene-Protein-Reaction associations.</p>
